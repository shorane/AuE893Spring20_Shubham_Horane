# Self-driving package developement on a ROS-based TurtleBot Burger robot:
This repository contains ROS-development files prepared as a part of assignment submissions pertaining to AuE893_Spring2020 at Clemson University
All packages were developed on an Ubuntu 16.04 machine runnning ROS Kinetic.
The file structure of this repository is similar to a ROS-Kinetic file system:<br />
workspace_folder    <br />
  src               <br />
    package_name    <br />
      launch        <br />
      nodes         <br />
      videos        <br />
      other_support_folders     <br />
      

Each package contains its own README.md file which has detailed description of its functionality and the commands used to run these packages.
